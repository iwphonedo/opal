title: Deploy OPAL+
---

With OPAL+, you get access to private Docker images that include additional features and capabilities.
To apply for Permit OPAL+, [fill in the form available here](https://hello.permit.io/opal-plus)

In order to access the OPAL+ Docker images, you need to have Docker Hub credentials with an access token.
Those should be received from your Customer Success manager.
Reach out to us [on Slack](https://bit.ly/permit-slack) if you need assistance.

## Accessing the OPAL+ Docker Images

To access the OPAL+ Docker images, you need to log in to Docker Hub with your credentials.
You can do this by running the [docker login](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/login/) command:

```bash
docker login -u <username> -p <password>
```

If you are using Kubernetes, check out the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/) on how to pull images from a private registry.

After logging in, you can pull the OPAL+ Docker images using the following commands:

```bash
docker pull permitio/opal-plus:latest
```

## Running the OPAL+ Docker Images

Running the OPAL+ Docker images is similar to running the open-source OPAL images.

Check out the [OPAL Docker documentation](/getting-started/running-opal/run-docker-containers) for more information.
