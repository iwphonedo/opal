When something goes wrong, we are here to help.

Feel free to reach out to us on Slack on our [community channel](https://bit.ly/opal-slack)
or in your dedicated OPAL+ support channel, and we will do our best to assist you quickly.

### Seeking Support

When seeking support, please provide as much information as possible to help us understand the issue and resolve it faster.
This includes:
* Full description of the problem
* Steps to reproduce the issue
* Environment details (OS, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)

You can also provide the following information:

#### Extract Logs

On production, we advise you to connect OPAL+ to your logging system to collect logs.
Configure the [OPAL_LOG_SERIALIZE](/getting-started/configuration) environment variable to `true` to serialize logs in JSON format.

When running OPAL+ locally or in a development environment, you can extract logs from the console.
Alternatively, you can enable logging to file by setting the [OPAL_LOG_TO_FILE](/getting-started/configuration) to `true`.

You can also enable debug logs by setting the [OPAL_LOG_LEVEL](/getting-started/configuration) environment variable to `debug`.

#### Export Configuration

You can export your configuration by running the following command:

```bash
opal-client print-config
```

Make sure to censor any sensitive information, like passwords or API keys, before sharing the configuration.

More common issues and their solutions are available in the [OPAL documentation](/getting-started/running-opal/troubleshooting).
